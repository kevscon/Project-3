# Purple Counties in the 2016 Election
Our nation is divided. There is an intractable split among voters between our two major political parties. As time marches forward, it seems the rift between these two sides only widens throughout the country. The media portrays a bitter battle between Republican (red) and Democrat (blue) voters as exemplified in maps such as the one above. However, it is voters in the middle who may very well determine the outcome of presidential elections. Perhaps the focus should be on the purple voters in between the red and blue.

Can characteristics of these voters be identified? Practically, this information could be used to shed light on which voters political campaigns should target to tip the balance in a tight election. More generally, insight may be gained into the attributes of the ever-shrinking segment of our population that is not politically entrenched.
