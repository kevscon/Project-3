# Battleground Counties in the 2016 Election

Our nation is divided. We have a bitter split among voters between our two major political parties. As time marches forward, it seems the rift between these two sides only deepens throughout the country. But many election outcomes may come down to just a set of particular voters in a handful of counties. Can characteristics of these voters be identified? Obviously this information could be used to shed light on which voters political campaigns should target to tip the balance in a tight election. More generally, insight may be gained into the attributes of the ever-shrinking segment of our population that is not politically entrenched.

## Summary
This project analyzed the results of the 2016 election at the county level and compared them to demographics to determine if any trends were apparent for the most undecided counties.
